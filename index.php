<p><h2>When i was 10 yrs old ,i used to play playstation together with my friends.
When i was in high school, it is the time where the computer known,
i spend a lot of my time playing online games on it, i even make a lot of absences just to play .
I noticed that i am addicted into it , as a result i got a low grades and the worst is i failed
my other subjects . I had to undergo summer classes just to graduate in high school.
after i graduate , I've been into defferent kinds of job, i experience how difficult life would 
be if you were just a high school graduated , and so , i decided to continue my studies and procced
to college. I choose this course because i am a computer enthusiast and i want to create my own online game.
