<p><h2>When i was a 10yrs old, i used to play playstation together with my friends.
when i was in high school, it is the time where computer is known, i spend a lot
of my time playing online games on it, i even make a lot of absences 
just to play. I noticed that i am addicted into it, as a result i got low grades and the worst 
is i failed my other subjects. I had to undergo summer classes just to graduate in high school.
after i graduate , I've been into different kinds of job, i experience how difficult life
would be if you were just a high school graduated, and so, i decided to continue my studies and procced
to college. I choose this this course because i am a computer enthusiasts and i want to create my own online games.
